# Zklear Frontend

A beautiful React application for interacting with the Zklear zero-knowledge payment system.

## Features

- **ðŸ“Š Dashboard**: Real-time system statistics and Merkle root visualization
- **ðŸ‘¤ Account Management**: Create accounts with random addresses
- **ðŸ’¸ Transaction Creation**: Create transactions between accounts
- **âš¡ Batch Processing**: Process transactions with zero-knowledge proofs
- **ðŸ“š API Documentation**: Comprehensive API specification page
- **ðŸŽ¨ Beautiful Design**: Light beige background with white cards and black text

## Design

The application features a clean, modern design with:
- Light beige gradient background (`#f5f5dc` to `#f0f0e0`)
- White content cards with subtle shadows
- Black buttons and text for excellent contrast
- Responsive layout that works on all devices
- Smooth animations and hover effects

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure the Zklear API server is running:
   ```bash
   # In the main project directory
   cargo run -- serve --port 8081
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from Create React App (one-way operation)

## Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dashboard.tsx      # Main dashboard with stats and forms
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ApiSpec.tsx        # API documentation page
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Navigation.tsx     # Navigation component
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api.ts            # API service for backend communication
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx               # Main app component with routing
â”œâ”€â”€ App.css               # Beautiful styling
â””â”€â”€ index.tsx             # App entry point
```

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the Zklear API server running on `http://localhost:8081`. The API service provides:

- System information and statistics
- Account creation and management
- Transaction creation and listing
- Batch processing with zero-knowledge proofs

## Features in Detail

### Dashboard
- **System Overview**: Real-time stats including account count, transaction count, total balance, and average balance
- **Merkle Root Display**: Shows the current Merkle root in a monospace font
- **Account Creation**: Form to create new accounts with random addresses
- **Transaction Creation**: Form to create transactions between accounts
- **Batch Processing**: Button to process all pending transactions
- **Account List**: Shows all accounts with truncated addresses and balances
- **Transaction List**: Shows pending transactions with status badges

### API Documentation
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All API endpoints with examples
- **Request/Response Examples**: Real JSON examples for each endpoint
- **Testing Examples**: Curl commands for testing the API
- **Feature Overview**: Explanation of zero-knowledge proofs and Merkle trees

## Technologies Used

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Axios** for API communication
- **CSS3** with custom styling (no external UI libraries)
- **Modern JavaScript** features

## Development

The app is built with modern React practices:
- Functional components with hooks
- TypeScript for type safety
- Custom CSS for complete design control
- Responsive design principles
- Clean component architecture

## Browser Support

The app works on all modern browsers:
- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **API Connection Error**: Make sure the Zklear API server is running on port 8081
2. **CORS Issues**: The API server includes CORS headers for localhost:3000
3. **Build Errors**: Try `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed

## Contributing

To modify the frontend:

1. Edit components in `src/components/`
2. Update styling in `src/App.css`
3. Modify API calls in `src/services/api.ts`
4. Test changes with `npm start`

The design is fully customizable through the CSS file, allowing you to easily change colors, spacing, and layout.
